**Fig 4. The number of ER-mitochondria contact sites increase and they are clustered in infection.**
**(a)** Visualization of the mitochondrial structure by the ten-fold robust expansion microscopy (TREx) in noninfected and infected Vero cells at 8 hpi (n = 6). The distributions of an ER protein tyrosine vesicle-associated membrane protein B (VAPB, yellow) located in the ER-mitochondria contact sites and mitochondria labeled with MitoTracker (magenta) are shown. The localization of the nuclear viral replication compartment and the cytoplasmic viral ICP4 protein are presented by HSV-1 EYFP-ICP4 (cyan) and the nucleus by the DAPI stain (blue). Scale bars, 1 μm. **(b)** Violin plots show the distance between the mitochondria and VAPB. **(c)** Proximity ligation analysis (PLA) of contact sites in noninfected and infected Vero cells at 4, 8, and 12 hpi. The PLA signal between VAPB and regulator of microtubule dynamics (RMDN3) is visualized by fluorescent spots (yellow). Mitochondria are labeled with MitoTracker (red), the nucleus with DAPI, and viral replication compartments are visualized by EYFP-ICP4. Scale bars, 10 μm. **(d)** Box plots showing the number of PLA foci and **(e)** volume of the foci per cell (ncells = 27, 27, 28, and 24 for NI, 4, 8, and 12 hpi, respectively). The box plots show the mean (dashed line) and the interquartile range. Statistical significance was determined using the Student´s t-test. The significance values are denoted as **** (p<0.0001), ** (p<0.01), * (p<0.05) or ns (not significant).
