Crop if needed with a clear outside and save with the correct color as tif

Candidate for visualization/figure
NI: 49
4 hpi: 55
8 hpi: 41
12 hpi : 67, 55, 53, 50, 48, 46

Objective:
Count PLA spots

Methods:
Nucleus segmentation and removal from other channels
Mitochondria segmentation
PLA signal segmentation with optionnal watershed. Objective is to detect the signal that have a spherical shape of a given volume.
Label the PLA signal and filter by their size (should be similar).
Count them
Detect their centroid and measure the distance to the closest mitochondria (optional)

Results:
Shorter distance to mitochondria and more PLA signal in infected cells


Images for figure
Set the PLA signal and ICP4 to be the same range for all the condition
 - PLA: 72-255
- ICP4: 77-255
Set the mitochondria and nucleus to be optimal for each condition (auto)
