**Fig 5. The cristae become thicker and shorter along the progression of the infection.**

**(a)** Representative focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) images of noninfected and HSV-1-infected MEF cells at 8 hpi. The mitochondrial outer membrane (yellow) and cristae (green) are shown. Scale bars, 0.5 μm. **(b)** The 3D structure of cristae (green) reconstructed from FIB-SEM stacks. See also S4 Movie. The 3D quantitative analysis of **(c)** the maximal thickness and **(d)** the length of cristae calculated using a watershed algorithm to individualize the cristae lamella in noninfected and infected cells (nmito = 8, ncrist = 112 and 121 for NI and 8 hpi, respectively). **(e)** The surface area of segmented cristae in each mitochondria. The box plots show the mean (dashed line) and the interquartile range. Statistical significance was determined using the Student´s t-test. The significance values are denoted as **** (p<0.0001) or ns (not significant).
