**Fig 3. ER-mitochondria contacts increase in infection.**
**(a)** Representative sections of serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) of noninfected and infected MEF cells at 8 and 12 hpi. White squares show the magnified mitochondria. The pseudocolor lines around the mitochondria show the closeness of ER and mitochondria, and regions of contact are defined as points where opposed membranes are within 30 nm of each other (red). Scale bars, 0.5 Î¼m. **(b)** Higher-magnification 3D SBF-SEM reconstructions show the regions of contact (distance less than 30 nm, red) between mitochondria (pseudocolor) and ER (grey). The pseudocolor bar indicates the distance between the ER and mitochondria. See also S3 Movie. Violin and box plots show **(c)** the ER-mitochondria distance, **(d)** the number (Nb) of contact sites/mitochondrial surface area, and **(e)** the area of the contact sites (nmito = 43, 43, and 39 for NI, 8, 12 hpi, respectively). The box plots show the mean (dashed line) and the interquartile range. Statistical significance was determined using the Brunner-Munzel test. The significance values are denoted as **** (p<0.0001), *** (p<0.001), *(p<0.05), or ns (not significant).
