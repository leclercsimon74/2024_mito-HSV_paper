**S3 Fig. Mitochondria elongate as the infection proceeds.**
**(a)** Serial block face scanning electron microscopy (SBF-SEM) images of noninfected and infected MEF cells at 8 and 12 hpi. Scale bars: 2 μm. **(b)** Quantitative analysis of mitochondrial length (nmito = 202, 64, and 244 for NI, 8, and 12 hpi, respectively). The box plots show the mean (dashed line) and the interquartile range. Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t-test. The significance values are denoted as **** (p<0.0001), *(p<0.05), or ns (not significant).
