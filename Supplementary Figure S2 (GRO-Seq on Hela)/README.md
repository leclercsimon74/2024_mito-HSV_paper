**S2 Fig. Analysis of nascent RNA levels of mitochondrial and mitochondria-associated proteins in infected Hela cells.**
**(a)** A Venn comparison of GRO-Seq dataset showing gene regulation of mitochondrial protein-ssociated gene expression in infected Hela cells at 4 and 8 hpi. The number of regulated proteins at 4 (green) and 8 hpi (pink), or at both time points (blue) is shown. The size of the circle is proportional to the number of regulated proteins. **(b)** The upregulation and downregulation of mitochondrial genes at 4 and 8 hpi clustered according to their predicted functional biological process during infection. The horizontal line at value 0 represents gene expression in noninfected cells, and positive and negative values represent the upregulation and downregulation of gene expression, respectively.
