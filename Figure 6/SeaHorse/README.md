Here is a detailed analysis of the provided code:

### Summary
This Python script is used for generating several plots that visualize the results of an experiment. The experiment compares the effects of different conditions on oxygen consumption rate (OCR) in cells. The conditions include non-infected cells and cells infected for different periods (4 hours and 8 hours). The script performs statistical tests, applies annotations, and saves the plots as both PNG and SVG files.

### Code Breakdown

1. **Imports and Setup:**
    - The script uses libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Pandas, Scipy, and Numpy.
    - `statannotations` is used for adding statistical annotations to the plots.
    - A utility script `utils` is imported, which contains a function `get_color`.

2. **Color Setup:**
    - Custom colors are set for the Seaborn plots.

3. **Helper Functions:**
    - `make_swarmplot`: Creates a combined boxplot and swarmplot with statistical annotations.
    - `get_data`: Filters the data based on Z-scores to remove outliers.

4. **Data Loading:**
    - The main data is loaded from `Results.csv`, which is extracted from '20230808  - Simon - XF Cell Mito Stress Test.xlsx' generated by SeaHorse.

5. **Plot Generation:**
    - Different subplots are created for different categories such as `Basal Respiration`, `Proton Leak`, etc.
    - Data is processed and plots are generated using the helper functions.

7. **Saving Figures:**
    - The figures are saved in both PNG and SVG formats for high-quality outputs.

8. **Supplementary Figures:**
    - Additional figures are generated and saved in a similar manner:

9. **Main Figure with OCR Data:**
    - Another dataset `Rate_data.csv` is loaded for the main figure which includes time-series data.
    - The data is processed and specific wells are excluded as needed.
    - OCR data is plotted over time with error bars, and additional swarm plots are included for different categories.
