**Fig 6. The infection leads to an increase in the mitochondrial proton leakage and Ca2+ content.**

**(a)** Seahorse real-time cell metabolic analysis of oxygen consumption rate (OCR) traces of noninfected and infected MEF cells at 4 and 8 hpi. The arrows mark the addition of oligomycin, FCCP, and rotenone + antimycin A (n = 30 000 cells, 6 replicates). Box plots showing **(b)** basal OCR, **(c)** ATP production, **(d)** proton leak, and **(e)** coupling efficiency (ATP/O). **(f)** The live cell analysis of the mitochondrial calcium labelled by calcium ion indicator Rhod2-AM (green) selectively accumulating within mitochondria, and mitotracker (red). The infected cells selected for imaging were identified by the expression of HSV-1 ICP4 (not shown). Scale bars, 10 μm. **(g)** The quantitative analysis of mitochondrial [Ca2+] in noninfected and infected cells at 4 and 8 hpi (n = 207, 97, and 96 for NI, 4, and 8 hpi, respectively). The box plots show the mean (dashed line) and the interquartile range. Statistical significance was determined using the Student’s t-test. The significance values shown are denoted as **** (p<0.0001), ** (p<0.01), *(p<0.05), or ns (not significant).
