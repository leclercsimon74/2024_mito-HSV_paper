**S4 Fig. Technical controls in the PLA assay.**
Representative images of the PLA technical controls showing the PLA signals in noninfected cells either without the PLA probes (left), without the VAPB antibody (middle), or without the RMDN3 antibody (right). The PLA signals between VAPB and RMDN3 are visualized in yellow. Mitochondria are labeled with MitoTracker (magenta), the nucleus with DAPI (blue), and EYFP-ICP4 is used as the viral marker (cyan). The marked areas are magnified on the right side of each image, showing the PLA signal together with the mitotracker, only the mitotracker, and only the PLA signal, respectively. Scale bars, 10 Î¼m.
