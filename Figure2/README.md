**Fig 2. The progression of infection leads to thinner and rougher mitochondria.**

**(a)** Cryo-soft X-ray tomography (SXT) thin slices (ortho slices) of suspended MEF cells in glass capillaries and **(b)** 3D reconstructions of segmented mitochondria (brown) in the cytoplasm around the nucleus (blue) in noninfected (NI) and infected MEF cells at 4 and 8 hpi. White and black squares show the magnified mitochondria. Scale bars, 2 μm. See also S1 Movie. Box plots of **(c)** linear absorption coefficient (LAC) values (grayscale bar 0.1–0.5 1/microns), **(d)** number, and **(e)** volume of mitochondria in noninfected and infected cells (ncells = 6, nmito = 1349, 2158, and 1713 for NI, 4 and 8 hpi, respectively). **(f)** SXT images of adherent MEF cells grown on EM grids and **(g)** 3D presentations of segmented mitochondria (brown) and nuclear envelope (blue) in noninfected and infected MEF cells at 8 and 12 hpi. The magnified mitochondria are shown in white and black squares. Scale bars, 2 μm. See also S2 Movie. **(h)** The distance of mitochondria from the nucleus, **(i)** the diameter along the short axis, and **(j)** surface-to-volume ratio analysis of mitochondrial roughness in noninfected and infected cells (ncells = 12, 4, and 13, nmito = 1089, 364, and 1165 for NI, 8, and 12 hpi, respectively). The box plots show the mean (dashed line) and the interquartile range. Statistical significance was determined using the Brunner-Munzel test. The significance values shown are denoted as **** (p<0.0001), * (p<0.05), or ns (not significant).

This script performs various tasks related to analyzing and visualizing mitochondrial data from two different datasets: Berkeley and ALBA:
- Data Loading: The script loads data from pickle files (ALBA_data.pckl and Berkeley_data.pckl) containing information about mitochondrial features such as number, volume, distance to nucleus, etc.
- Data Processing: It processes the loaded data to compute various statistical measures (e.g., mean, variance, skewness, kurtosis) for each condition (Noninfected, 4 hpi, 8 hpi, 12 hpi) and each parameter (e.g., mito number, LAC, volume, etc.). It uses methods from the scipy.stats library for statistical analysis.
- Data Visualization: It creates swarm plots for each parameter, comparing different conditions. These plots display the distribution of data points for each condition along with statistical annotations showing significant differences between conditions.

Image Visualization: It loads and visualizes images related to mitochondrial data for both datasets (Berkeley and ALBA). For Berkeley, it displays grayscale images representing LAC values at different time points (Noninfected, 4 hpi, 8 hpi). For ALBA, it displays grayscale images showing mitochondria at different time points (Noninfected, 8 hpi, 12 hpi).

Statistical Analysis: It saves the computed statistical measures (e.g., mean, variance) as both CSV and pickle files for further analysis or reference.

Image Export: It exports the generated images as PNG and SVG files for further use or publication.

The script uses various Python libraries such as 'numpy', 'tifffile', 'pickle', 'scipy', 'seaborn', 'panda's, and 'matplotlib' for data processing, analysis, and visualization. Additionally, it has dependencies on a custom utility module named 'utils'.
