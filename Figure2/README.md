**Fig 2. The progression of infection leads to thinner and rougher mitochondria.**

**(a)** Cryo-soft X-ray tomography (SXT) thin slices (ortho slices) of suspended MEF cells in glass capillaries and **(b)** 3D reconstructions of segmented mitochondria (brown) in the cytoplasm around the nucleus (blue) in noninfected (NI) and infected MEF cells at 4 and 8 hpi. White and black squares show the magnified mitochondria. Scale bars, 2 μm. See also S1 Movie. Box plots of **(c)** linear absorption coefficient (LAC) values (grayscale bar 0.1–0.5 1/microns), **(d)** number, and **(e)** volume of mitochondria in noninfected and infected cells (ncells = 6, nmito = 1349, 2158, and 1713 for NI, 4 and 8 hpi, respectively). **(f)** SXT images of adherent MEF cells grown on EM grids and **(g)** 3D presentations of segmented mitochondria (brown) and nuclear envelope (blue) in noninfected and infected MEF cells at 8 and 12 hpi. The magnified mitochondria are shown in white and black squares. Scale bars, 2 μm. See also S2 Movie. **(h)** The distance of mitochondria from the nucleus, **(i)** the diameter along the short axis, and **(j)** surface-to-volume ratio analysis of mitochondrial roughness in noninfected and infected cells (ncells = 12, 4, and 13, nmito = 1089, 364, and 1165 for NI, 8, and 12 hpi, respectively). The box plots show the mean (dashed line) and the interquartile range. Statistical significance was determined using the Brunner-Munzel test. The significance values shown are denoted as **** (p<0.0001), * (p<0.05), or ns (not significant).
